# Pyhsarum-Polycephalum

This repository contains all the scripts used to develop my Bachelor's thesis: "Physarum polycephalum inspired algorithm for the artificial generation of Madrid's metro and train network".  The initial code, and core of this thesis, was obtained from GitHub \url{https://github.com/ammitra/Physarum/blob/main/main.py}. An explanation of each script functionality is given hereafter.
- PPA.py: the main script. It is a OPP algorithm based on Physarum polycephalum. It contains two classes: one to define the Environment and other define the Particles. Each class has several methods. An explanation of the methods' functionality is within the code. 
- pp_image_process.py: script to get the population percentage, pp, corresponding to the metro and train case.
- adjacency_matrix_coefficient.R: script to analyse the adjacency matrices constructed with Microsoft Excel. The script returns Jaccard Index values. For this, it uses some functions from the next script
- la.functions.R: script with several functions for statistical and machine learning analysis.
